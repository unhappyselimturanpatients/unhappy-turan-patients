                        Dr. Selim Turan in his office
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>Dr. Selim Turan is a well-known surgeon in Turkey whose work is frequently praised by dedicated
                    promoters
                    across WhatsApp groups, Reddit, and Google reviews. However, the high volume and severity of
                    complaints,
                    particularly regarding ethics, patient care, and long-term outcomes, suggest that prospective
                    patients
                    should proceed with caution.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Many unhappy patients describe Turan as a surgeon who prioritizes his own aesthetic preferences and
                    business interests over individual needs and well-being. Despite his popularity, he is on the
                    botched
                    list, with reported complications including bumps, dents, asymmetries, loss of turbinates, necrosis,
                    infections, overly rotated tips, unconsented procedures, overly feminized results in male patients,
                    and
                    permanent functional damage such as breathing problems and structural deformities.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Patients frequently report being gaslighted, ignored, or dismissed when voicing concerns. Many are
                    left
                    emotionally distressed, financially burdened, and without proper aftercare. Revisions are allegedly
                    inconsistently offered and usually require patients to cover hospital fees, only to usually end up
                    with
                    the same problem or new ones. We created this document to highlight the most commonly reported
                    issues
                    and help others make informed decisions.</p>

                <div class="issues-list">
                    <h3>1. Dents and Bumps</h3>
                    <p>Dents and bumps are among the most frequently reported aesthetic complications from Dr. Turan.
                        Patients often mention visible irregularities on the bridge or sidewalls of the nose, including
                        unnatural indentations, uneven surfaces, and unwanted dorsal humps.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These issues often result from excessive or uneven cartilage removal, poor structural support, or
                        imprecise grafting techniques. In some cases, dents appear over time as swelling subsides or as
                        a
                        result of cartilage collapse, while bumps may be due to incomplete hump reduction or scar
                        tissue.
                        Many patients say these flaws were not present before surgery and contribute significantly to
                        their
                        dissatisfaction with the results.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="issues-list">
                    <h3>2. Nostril Asymmetries</h3>
                    <p>Nostril asymmetries are another common complaint among Dr. Selim Turan's patients and can stem
                        from
                        several surgical missteps. These include uneven alar base reductions, imprecise stitching, poor
                        cartilage support, uneven tip projections or imbalanced cephalic trims. When one side is
                        over-resected or not properly matched to the other, it can result in visible differences in
                        nostril
                        size, shape, or positioning especially noticeable from the basal (underside) view.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In many cases, patients reported that these asymmetries were present immediately after cast
                        removal,
                        suggesting surgical error rather than healing complications. Fixing nostril asymmetry often
                        requires
                        complex revision work, and if too much tissue was removed, it may be difficult or impossible to
                        fully correct.</p>

                    <h3>3. Unnecessary and Unconsented Alarplasties with Hypertrophic Scars</h3>
                    <p>This surgeon is known to routinely perform the more aggressive weir (wedge and sill) alarplasty
                        excisions, often with little regard for patient consent. Despite being an irreversible
                        procedure, it
                        is reportedly performed frequently, often without proper discussion or approval. In one case, a
                        patient's nostrils were drastically reduced without consent, resulting in permanent disruption
                        to
                        their facial harmony and C-PTSD from the bodily violation. Two patients explicitly asked the
                        surgeon
                        not to perform alarplasty during their consultation, only to wake up and discover it had been
                        done
                        anyway.</p>
                    <p>Multiple other patients have developed hypertrophic and emotional scars from this procedure.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="issues-list">
                    <h3>4. Multiple Surgeries a Day</h3>
                    <p>The surgeon is known to routinely perform 3 surgeries per day, with multiple patients reporting
                        that
                        he handled 4 on their scheduled date and allegedly up to 5 on peak days. Following a rise in
                        patient
                        complications and cancellations, he has reportedly reduced his caseload to 2 surgeries per day.
                        However, prospective patients are strongly advised to take this history into careful
                        consideration.
                        If he does more than 2 on your day, that is a red flag.</p>

                    <h3>5. Necrosis & Infections</h3>
                    <p>Several patients developed necrosis that led to open wounds, with no clear accountability or
                        follow-up from the surgeon. In many instances, infection concerns raised by patients were
                        dismissed
                        or downplayed often until it was too late. Reported cases include infections in the columella
                        and
                        nostrils, along with at least one internal infection that led to recurring nosebleeds. One
                        patient
                        developed an infection months after surgery which, due to a lack of timely intervention,
                        progressed
                        into a severe structural deformity. Many more cases may remain undocumented or unacknowledged.

                    <h3>6. Unauthorized Publishing of Patients' Photos and Messages</h3>
                    <p>Turan has been reported to share patients' photos on his social media without obtaining proper
                        consent, and often refusing to remove them when asked. Patients report being gaslighted with
                        lies
                        such as "Instagram would ban me" or dismissive comments such as "who would even recognize you?"
                        In
                        multiple instances, the surgeon only took down photos after patients threatened legal action or
                        negative reviews. He has also reportedly shared private messages with patients, breaching
                        surgeon-patient confidentiality. In one case, he reportedly shared a photo of a patient on
                        Instagram
                        to give the impression they were satisfied, despite the patient having expressed dissatisfaction
                        privately. These actions could raise concerns under Turkish data protection law, specifically
                        KVKK
                        Article 12, which protects personal data and requires explicit consent for its use.</p>

                    <h3>7. Alleged Sexual Harassment </h3>
                    <p>This surgeon has been known to hit on his female patients to the point of making them extremely
                        uncomfortable. In one
                        case, the night before a scheduled surgery, he inappropriately insisted on meeting a patient at
                        her
                        hotel, under the
                        guise of it being unrelated to the consultation. When she asked why, he admitted it was
                        personal,
                        not medical, and
                        made comments suggesting romantic or sexual interest. The patient, feeling cornered and alarmed,
                        lied about being
                        married in an attempt to deter him.
                        She became so distraught that she went into surgery the next day terrified, stuffing tampons
                        inside
                        herself out of
                        fear that he might sexually violate her while she was under anesthesia. This is not just
                        unprofessional — it's
                        predatory, and it has no place in medicine.

                    <p>When he was confronted about this by another concerned patient, the surgeon allegedly tried to
                        deflect by falsely
                        claiming that the accuser was a gay man who had fallen in love with him. Rather than address the
                        serious concerns
                        being raised, he minimized the situation and dismissed the conversation entirely, saying he
                        didn't
                        care and that
                        "logical people can understand." When the patient pressed for clarification to determine whether
                        he
                        could still
                        trust him as a doctor, the surgeon coldly replied, "You should go another one," showing no
                        interest
                        in clearing his
                        name or reassuring prospective patients.

                    <p>Dr. Selim Turan has been reportedly using intimidation and gaslighting tactics to silence
                        patients
                        who speak publicly about their negative experiences. Several former patients have described
                        being
                        threatened with legal action or subjected to emotional manipulation. In some cases, he allegedly
                        tried to isolate them by saying things like, "The people you are speaking to don't care about
                        you,
                        let me and you solve this together," creating a false sense of trust while discouraging them
                        from
                        seeking outside support.
                        As a result, many patients are hesitant to share their stories. Some fear that speaking out may
                        lead
                        to retaliation, including the possibility that Dr. Turan could contact other surgeons to
                        interfere
                        with their ability to receive necessary revisions or follow-up care. This climate of fear has
                        left
                        many feeling vulnerable and unsupported, even as they continue to suffer complications from
                        their
                        procedures.</p>

                    <p> In addition to these concerns, Dr. Turan is also reported to upsell unnecessary cosmetic
                        procedures, often targeting patients' insecurities. These upsells have included
                        blepharoplasties, buccal fat removal, chin liposuction, and fillers, even when the patient
                        did not seek them. In one widely shared incident, he reportedly contacted an influencer
                        unsolicited to offer a nose correction, which resulted in public backlash in the
                        comments section of the post</p>

                    <h3>9. Negligence</h3>
                    <p>Patients who expressed concerns before surgery often had their requests ignored. In one case, a
                        patient clearly communicated their aesthetic preferences multiple times, yet received the
                        opposite
                        of what was agreed upon. When complications arose, patients were frequently dismissed, blamed,
                        or
                        pressured into paying for additional revisions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The surgeon has also been known to offer revisions to upset patients far too early, in unsafe
                        timeframes. In one case, a patient was offered a revision just one month after surgery, before
                        full
                        healing had occurred. Another patient developed an infection and nostril asymmetry that the
                        surgeon
                        repeatedly downplayed until necrotic skin developed. Instead of allowing the tissue to fully
                        heal,
                        he operated again within 6 months on tissue that was likely still compromised. As expected, the
                        wound reopened, likely due to the dead or dying tissue being unable to hold sutures.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Concerningly, he performed a second alarplasty on the same area just one week later,
                        further traumatizing already damaged skin without properly addressing the cause of the
                        initial failure. He also ignored the functional risks of further narrowing the nostrils,
                        which can severely impact breathing. During one of these operations, anesthesia
                        reportedly failed, and the patient felt the pain of the procedure. They later had to seek
                        help from a local ENT and are now left with serious skin and structural issues that will
                        be difficult to correct.</p>

                    <p>Turan has a pattern of poor outcomes among male patients, and based on these cases, he may not be
                        an
                        ideal choice for male rhinoplasty candidates. 6 male patients ended up with issues ranging from
                        wide, shapeless noses to noses that were overly feminine, rotated and unnaturally pointy without
                        consent. Some were left with severe bridge deformities, uneven alarplasty work, and major
                        breathing
                        problems. These changes affected not only their appearance, but also their sense of ethnic and
                        masculine identity.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>One patient, for example, got results that went completely against their wishes, leading to a
                        loss of
                        ethnic and masculine identity, scar tissue discomfort, functional issues, and an alarplasty that
                        removed way too much tissue with no care or precision. Most of these guys are now either stuck
                        with
                        permanent damage, overly feminine noses or need a highly complex revision that only a handful of
                        surgeons can even attempt.</p>

                    <p>Misleading narratives within the community often originate from promoters with ties to the
                        surgeon,
                        patients emotionally invested in justifying their decisions, and individuals financially
                        committed
                        to surgery who refuse to acknowledge risks. Stories of harm have been dismissed as mere rumors.
                        Requests for proof of other patients' negative experiences often come from a place of personal
                        bias
                        rather than a genuine desire to understand the risks, as those seeking reassurance in statistics
                        will rationalize their choices regardless of the evidence. While surgery is a personal decision,
                        disregarding legitimate health concerns to avoid confronting one's own fears distorts reality.
                        Due
                        to the consistent pattern of complications, misleading assurances, inadequate post-operative
                        care,
                        and unwillingness to acknowledge errors, prospective patients should exercise caution. To truly
                        understand the risks, speak with a patient needing revision.</p>

                <h2>Patient Testimonials</h2>

                <div id="patient1" class="patient-testimonial">
                    <h5>Patient 1</h5>
                    <p>A patient shared a serious warning about their experience with Dr. Selim Turan, describing it as
                        being botched. They originally went in to correct a deviated septum, only to come out of surgery
                        with the same issue and additional complications. During a post-op cleaning about a week after
                        surgery, a nurse used clamps that tore open their alar stitches, causing intense pain. The
                        patient
                        reported this to Dr. Turan, who scolded the nurse but refused to restitch the area. Once home,
                        the
                        wound reopened entirely, forcing the patient to seek emergency care where a local nurse had to
                        perform new stitches. This resulted in scarring and broken blood vessels on one side of the
                        nose.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The patient also reported poor hygiene and handling immediately after surgery. They described
                        intense
                        shaking from cold, bloody and unclean stitches, and the premature application of creams and
                        rinses
                        just hours after surgery. These practices were later revealed to be improper when compared to
                        the
                        more professional and sanitary care they received from a new surgeon. They were also left with a
                        visible bump on the nasal bridge, which was dismissed by Dr. Turan at cast removal but remained
                        a
                        year later. The final result, including an elongated bridge, low tip, and uneven nostrils,
                        looked
                        nothing like the simulation they were promised.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Attempts to receive a refund were denied, and the patient felt the entire experience was rushed,
                        cheap, and deeply unprofessional. They expressed frustration that Dr. Turan operates on multiple
                        patients per day and that their case felt like it was handled in a factory-like manner. After
                        undergoing a successful revision elsewhere, the patient urges others to avoid Dr. Turan,
                        emphasizing
                        how sharing this experience might help prevent others from enduring the same trauma.</p>

                    <h5>Patient 2</h5>
                    <p>At 6 months post-op, this patient is left with severe damage and emotional distress. They
                        initially
                        noticed nostril asymmetry but were told it was just swelling. When they requested surgical
                        photos,
                        they were only sent limited views, despite knowing others existed. Four days after surgery, they
                        developed an infection that was neglected until it caused visible tissue damage, scarring, and a
                        noticeable gap. Later, a second infection formed due to a non-dissolved suture. Their nostrils
                        became increasingly uneven, the columella crooked, and healing was poor.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Feeling they had no other option, the patient returned to Turan for a revision. He performed a
                        nostril reduction on damaged tissue, which made little difference. The stitches reopened within
                        days
                        due to necrosis, and the patient experienced the procedure fully because the anesthesia failed.
                        Despite screaming in pain, the surgeon continued operating and even attempted to straighten the
                        septum with tweezers without anesthesia. He blamed the complications on "bad genetics" rather
                        than
                        taking responsibility. A second nostril reduction was done just one week later on the same
                        inflamed
                        area.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After returning home, the stitches reopened again, and the patient was advised by local doctors
                        not
                        to proceed with further surgery due to the risk of necrosis. They are now left with permanent
                        deformities and an open scar. Initially staying silent due to fear and intimidation, the patient
                        chose to speak out in hopes of helping others avoid the same experience.</p>

                        ethnic features be preserved. He specifically pleaded with Dr. Turan not to over-project or
                        over-rotate the nose. Despite this, Turan reportedly ignored the patient's requests and took
                        extensive liberties with the procedure. The result included significant over-projection,
                        excessive
                        rotation, and an irreversible alarplasty performed without consent. The patient was left with
                        visible scarring, exacerbated by his ethnicity, along with a feminized nose that lacked harmony
                        with
                        his facial features, asymmetric nostrils, a crooked bridge, and partial collapse of the left
                        nasal
                        valve. The physical outcome has led to psychological distress and multiple rounds of trauma
                        recovery. </p>
                    <br>
                    To make matters worse, Turan posted the patient's photos on social media without obtaining
                    consent. The comments were largely negative, reflecting the drastic nature of the result. Turan
                    refused to remove the post until the patient began leaving negative reviews. He also reportedly
                    shared private messages from this patient with others in an effort to defend himself.</p>

                    <h5>Patient 4</h5>
                    <p>The patient experienced a range of complications following rhinoplasty with Dr. Turan, resulting
                        in
                        both physical discomfort and emotional distress. Shortly after surgery, the patient reported
                        intense
                        pain that did not respond to standard painkillers, and they expressed concern about the lack of
                        strong medication provided. They also experienced swelling, breathing difficulties, and
                        suspected an
                        infection. Over time, the patient began to feel that their nose appeared crooked, uneven at the
                        tip,
                        and that the nostrils were asymmetrical. Despite repeatedly expressing these concerns, they were
                        often told everything was "normal" without being asked to provide photos or videos for proper
                        assessment.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A few weeks post-op, the patient's discomfort intensified. They reported that the internal
                        sutures
                        appeared to be irritating the tissue, and they were uncertain whether the problem stemmed from
                        swelling or deeper complications. At one point, the patient was informed by a specialist that
                        their
                        nose was "a disaster," describing it as not swollen but structurally crooked with nostril
                        asymmetry.
                        Breathing was still impaired, and the doctor suspected there may be an infection at the nasal
                        tip.
                        Additionally, the patient was told that one of their turbinates had been altered in a way that
                        prevented it from functioning properly, further contributing to the breathing problem.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Emotionally, the patient described feeling overwhelmed, confused, and unsupported.
                        They mentioned inconsistent aftercare instructions between Dr. Turan and his
                        assistants, such as whether to wear the nasal retainer, which left them unsure of what to
                        do. The patient noted that their condition seemed to worsen rather than improve over
                        time, and they expressed fear that the situation might end in collapse. After waiting six
                        years to undergo revision surgery, the patient felt disheartened by the complications.</p>

                    <h5>Patient 5</h5>
                    <p>The patient experienced a cascade of complications and deeply distressing outcomes following
                        multiple
                        procedures performed by Dr. Selim Turan. One of the central complaints was the placement of
                        multiple
                        sharp structural grafts—including a crooked shield graft —in the nasal tip. These grafts
                        resulted in
                        a visibly angular, overly projected tip that extended past the columella. Since the surgery
                        multiple
                        rhinoplasty specialists have confirmed these grafts were poorly suited to the patient's anatomy,
                        particularly given naturally thin skin.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Another major concern was that the patient underwent alarplasty without informed consent. This
                        procedure had not been requested or discussed, and the patient only became aware of it after
                        seeing
                        changes in their post-operative appearance and reviewing surgical documentation. The patient
                        also
                        experienced TWO nasal infections after this surgery. Selim Turan denied that the patient had an
                        infection however the patients local physician was able to confirm the infection instantly and
                        get
                        the patient started on antibiotics to clear the infection.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Finally, the patient was left with a botched upper bleph consisting of atrophic, hypertrophic,
                        and
                        dog ear scars. Multiple oculoplastic surgeons have confirmed that Selim Turan had absolutely no
                        clue
                        what he was doing while performing this bleph. Too much skin was removed on such a young patient
                        and
                        the sutures were the wrong type of sutures to use on such delicate eye skin. The patient also
                        needed
                        punctal plugs inserted because the aggressive skin removal left them with the inability to fully
                        close their eyes and retain enough moisture in the eyes to function on a day to day basis. These
                        complications left the patient initially extremely suicidal, emotionally and physically
                        affected,
                        and they expressed a combination of anger, helplessness, and disbelief. They stated that they
                        would
                        never have allowed Dr. Turan to operate had they known what the outcomes would be, and that it
                        is
                        "the biggest mistake of their life".</p>

                <div id="patient6" class="patient-testimonial">
                    <h5>Patient 6</h5>
                    <p>The patient experienced multiple complications following rhinoplasty performed by Dr.
                        Turan. At nearly 7 months post-op, they reported dissatisfaction with the appearance of
                        the nasal tip, describing it as unnaturally sharp and asymmetrical, appearing noticeably
                        different from one side to the other. They also noted a prominent supra-tip break,
                        which contributed to an uneven and unintended nasal contour. The patient stated that
                        the nasal tip was rotated without their consent, deviating from the aesthetic goals they
                        had discussed with the surgeon, and noted that the tip grafts were improperly placed,
                        resulting in a crooked and asymmetric appearance. While they acknowledged some
                        aspects of the result were acceptable, the asymmetry, unnatural shape, and unauthorized
                        tip rotation caused persistent frustration.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Concerns also arose regarding a steroid injection administered during recovery.
                        Although the injection was explained as necessary due to thick skin, the patient believed
                        their skin was actually thin, citing their ability to feel bone through the skin even prior
                        to surgery. They also reported being prescribed Accutane in a seemingly haphazard
                        manner. These discrepancies led the patient to question whether the treatment
                        approach was appropriate for their anatomy and whether it may have contributed to the
                        complications they experienced.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In addition to nasal concerns, the patient reported scarring issues. The nose developed
                        uneven healing patterns, with a hypertrophic scar on one side and an atrophic scar on
                        the other. Despite repeatedly reaching out to Dr. Turan’s team, the patient received only
                        generalized reassurances and was consistently told to wait. Over time, the lack of direct
                        engagement led to increasing frustration and a growing sense of neglect in how their
                        outcome was managed.</p>

                            review—it's a warning. What happened to this patient at the hands of this surgeon was not
                            just a
                            surgical failure, it was a profound violation of trust, identity, and bodily autonomy. This

                        <p><span class="emoji">🚩</span>From the very beginning, the red flags were there. The surgeon
                            was
                            aggressive, manipulative, and dismissive of her boundaries. She came to him with a simple
                            request: to slim the bottom part of her nose. She was crystal clear, she did not want to
                            change
                            her side profile, and she told him explicitly that she wouldn't go through with the surgery
                            unless he could guarantee that. Instead of respecting that, he pressured her into accepting
                            a
                            drastically different, upturned, scooped profile: the only type of nose he seems capable of
                            doing. He even morphed photos of her face to convince her, completely ignoring her refusal.
                            She
                            never gave consent for these changes, yet he performed them anyway.</p>

                            proudly stating that Northern European noses are the ideal. As a Middle Eastern woman, her
                            ethnic features were not only dismissed, they were surgically erased. He shamelessly told
                            her
                            that his only difficult patients were her and another ethnic individual, despite having
                            problematic cases from all backgrounds. His racism was blatant and disturbing, reflecting a
                            deeper cultural prejudice against Arabs in Turkey, fueled by propaganda and Western
                            idolization.

                            soon as
                            the cast came off, she knew something was deeply wrong. She had panic attacks on the flight
                            home. Seven days after surgery, she removed her tape and saw the full extent of what he had
                            done. Her bridge was shaved down without permission. Her nostrils were uneven. Her natural
                            structure was gone. Her left turbinate had been removed, and her internal nasal valve had
                            collapsed. She could no longer breathe comfortably. Her nose was dry, painful, and
                            completely
                            foreign to her.</p>

                            consulted
                            confirmed the irreversible damage: a missing turbinate, internal valve collapse, and visible

                            seconds. He told her that her tip would drop and walked away, ignoring her distress. The
                            entire
                            patient experience was factory-like, impersonal, careless, and dangerously detached.</p>

                <div id="patient9" class="patient-testimonial">
                    <h5>Patient 9</h5>
                    <p>One patient described a devastating experience with Dr. Selim Turan, expressing deep
                        disappointment not only in the surgical outcome but also in the doctor’s behavior and
                        lack of accountability. The patient originally sought rhinoplasty to address a mild
                        downward tip movement when smiling. Prior to surgery, her nose was straight and
                        proportional. Despite thoroughly researching reviews, she later discovered that multiple
                        other patients in Istanbul had also experienced complications, raising concerns about
                        underreported negative outcomes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>During the in-person consultation, Dr. Turan attempted to upsell additional facial
                        procedures, which the patient found invasive and unprofessional. After surgery, he
                        showed her initial photos of the result, where she immediately noticed a crooked
                        appearance. Though she had signed a form prohibiting her photos from being shared
                        publicly, she was shocked to see them posted on Dr. Turan’s Instagram the next day.
                        When confronted, he dismissed her concern with the response,
                        “Who’s going to recognize you?”, a remark that left the patient feeling deeply violated
                        and unsafe under his care.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As time went on, the nasal asymmetry worsened. In a follow-up video call, Dr. Turan
                        acknowledged the crookedness and suggested that she massage her nose to
                        “push it straight,” an alarming and medically questionable recommendation. A month later,
                        with no improvement, the patient returned to Istanbul. Rather than see her at his office,
                        Dr. Turan instructed his staff to direct her to a hospital so as not to alarm other patients.
                        He again admitted the deformity, attempted to manually reposition the nose, and then
                        suggested filler injections just one month post-op, something the patient refused given
                        the risk so early post op. Though her contract allowed for refunds in cases of medical
                        negligence, Dr. Turan refused, falsely claiming that “Turkey cannot wire money back.”
                        Instead of offering support, he ended their final call with a mocking thumbs up.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The emotional toll of the experience has been significant. The patient believes many
                        others remain silent, possibly hoping for corrections in future surgeries. She warns
                        others considering cosmetic procedures, especially abroad, that the contracts often
                        protect only the surgeon, not the patient. Her message is clear: if you're looking for a
                        sign to reconsider, this is it.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="patient10" class="patient-testimonial">
                    <h5>Patient 10</h5>
                    <p>The patient underwent a rhinoplasty with Dr. Turan that left them highly dissatisfied
                        with both the aesthetic outcome and the follow-up communication. The patient had
                        initially discussed a nose design featuring a slight curve and a more upturned tip.</p>
                    <p>However, a year after surgery, the patient observed the presence of a hump, a drooping
                        tip, and an overall longer and larger nose, features they explicitly did not request. The
                        final result looked nothing like the simulation that was initially shown. When the
                        patient raised these concerns with Dr. Turan and shared photos, he responded via voice
                        note claiming the current nose matched what was discussed, and even asserted that the
                        patient had asked for the straight design. The patient felt gaslighted by this denial and
                        pointed out that their sister had been present during consultations where a slight curve
                        was agreed upon.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The patient also expressed dissatisfaction with the outcome of the rib scar, which was
                        left open and stitches were sticking out. Concerned inquiries as to why the wound was
                        left open were not answered in messages or in person. The wound healed with a deep
                        scarring, which, according to the surgeon in the patient's hometown, could have been
                        prevented. Later inquiries and concerns about the scar were only answered with "just use
                        scar ex".</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The patient also expressed frustration over being offered a revision for €3000, which felt
                        inappropriate given that the original outcome did not reflect the preoperative
                        agreements and the patient was assured in advance that only €1500 hospital fees would
                        be charged in the event of a necessary correction. They emphasized that the issue was
                        not just stylistic preference but a failure to deliver what was promised. Specific
                        complaints included a nose that was longer, straighter, and had a more droopy tip than
                        requested. The patient had previously asked not to make the nose bigger, yet
                        sarcastically noted that the outcome was being blamed on their refusal to
                        “let him do his work,” implying the surgeon had deflected responsibility. They criticized Turan
                        for
                        producing similar nose styles for all patients, regardless of individual anatomy or
                        requests .</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Ultimately, the patient decided not to return to Dr. Turan for a revision, referencing a
                        previous experience where repeated revisions with the same surgeon led to worse
                        outcomes, including nasal collapse. They opted to seek care from a different doctor
                        known for a different aesthetic approach. Additionally, the patient was frustrated by
                        extra charges, such as €1500 for rib cartilage, even though rib grafts were already in
                        place from the original surgery. They viewed this as unprofessional and a breach of
                        initial revision agreements, emphasizing that the result was not due to healing
                        complications but unmet surgical expectations.</p>

                        described the overall experience as deeply disappointing. On the day of surgery, the
                        patient was left waiting for three hours, and once called in, the consultation was rushed.
                        Despite having traveled from abroad and feeling unsure, the patient proceeded with the
                        surgery due to the arrangements already in place. Initially, Dr. Turan stated the nose was
                        not complex, but after the results proved unsatisfactory, he later claimed it had been a
                        difficult case. Something a lot of patients complain that he does.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Following surgery, the patient experienced significant swelling, which clinic staff
                        dismissed as an allergic reaction and advised waiting. The final result was a nose with a
                        low-hanging tip and uneven thickness. When the patient raised concerns, Dr. Turan
                        reportedly responded with sarcasm and deflection, prescribing cortisone injections,
                        creams, and medications while blaming the patient’s skin type. One injection led to
                        visible nasal collapse, swelling, and exposed veins. Despite these complications, the
                        doctor recommended additional cortisone and even laser treatment, which the patient
                        found inappropriate given the worsening condition.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Over the course of the year, the patient waited for the swelling to resolve, as instructed,
                        but saw no improvement. At a follow-up, the doctor proposed another surgery,
                        requiring the patient to cover additional hospital fees. The patient ultimately felt that
                        the clinic prioritized profit over care, citing a lack of professionalism, poor
                        communication, and inadequate surgical outcomes. The holes caused by the cortisone
                        injection, according to the patient, left permanent damage that cannot be corrected with
                        another revision. As a result, the patient stated they would never trust Dr. Turan again
                        and strongly cautioned others against choosing him for surgery.</p>

                    <h5>Patient 12</h5>
                    <p>The patient experienced a prolonged and frustrating series of complications following
                        surgery with Dr. Turan. The initial procedure left them dissatisfied with the appearance
                        of the alar base, a visible dent, and a bump. Hoping for a less invasive solution, the
                        patient opted for a non-surgical correction rather than a full revision. However, the
                        correction failed to resolve the concerns, and the results remained unsatisfactory.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Later, the patient returned to Dr. Turan for a second correction, which worsened the
                        scarring without addressing the original issues. During communication with the
                        surgeon, the patient felt dismissed and invalidated. In response to their concerns, Dr.
                        Turan replied with “I tried my best 🙃” followed by an emoji, which the patient
                        interpreted as dismissive. At one point, the surgeon suggested that the patient was overly
                        focused on small details and even implied that the patient had a mental health issue. The
                        patient attempted to present their concerns clearly during a follow-up visit using an
                        iPad, but Dr. Turan reportedly refused to look and responded with anger. His tone only
                        shifted when the patient returned with a family member, at which point he became
                        more respectful, although the outcomes did not improve.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Over time, the patient decided to stop seeking assistance from the clinic. They noted
                        that the 2 year post-op support period had ended, the scars had worsened, and the initial
                        concerns remained unresolved. The patient also became aware that someone had
                        informed the clinic about their comments in another group, which further damaged the
                        relationship. Ultimately, the patient expressed a desire to move on, feeling emotionally
                        drained, unsupported, and disappointed by the lack of accountability and meaningful
                        resolution.</p>

                    <h5>Patient 13</h5>
                    <p>This patient turned to Turan for a revision after being drawn in by the seemingly
                        impressive results on Instagram—many of which, it turns out, were just table shots. His
                        primary surgery had been performed using his own rib by a relatively unknown surgeon,
                        but he was seeking further refinement, especially given Turan’s reputation for “defining
                        noses.”</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Hoping for a stronger, more masculine profile, he underwent his first revision with
                        Turan, who opted to use cadaver cartilage. Unfortunately, the long-term result included
                        a collapsed supratip and an amorphous, undefined nasal tip.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To make matters worse, Turan performed an unconsented alarplasty, further narrowing
                        the patient’s nostrils and leaving him with a nose that feels disharmonious with his facial
                        features. After seeking multiple consultations, he has now been advised that he’ll need
                        another revision—this time using his own rib again—to try to restore structure and
                        balance.</p>

                    <h5>Patient 14</h5>
                    <p>The patient experienced significant regret and disappointment following rhinoplasty
                        with Dr. Turan. Initially reassured by Turan's reputation and the pre-operative
                        simulation, the patient believed their aesthetic goals were well understood. However, the
                        actual surgical result differed noticeably from what was discussed. Around 6 months
                        post-op, the patient developed a visible depression in the mid-vault area, consistent with
                        saddling.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When concerns were raised, the patient felt dismissed and unsupported. Rather than
                        acknowledging the complication, Dr. Turan reportedly placed blame on the patient and
                        did not provide a constructive path forward. This lack of accountability was especially
                        troubling, as the patient believed the issue stemmed from overconfidence and
                        insufficient experience with complex cases.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The experience had a profound emotional impact. The patient described feelings of
                        isolation and distress, particularly as they had hoped the surgery would provide
                        improvement rather than create new issues. Over time, they came to believe that the
                        surgical approach lacked customization, with results often following a fixed aesthetic
                        regardless of individual anatomy. The patient ultimately viewed their case as a
                        cautionary example of the risks of relying on curated reputations and emphasized the
                        need for surgeon accountability.</p>

                        Turan, despite initially being impressed by his online presence and positive reviews.
                        Though the surgery itself seemed to go smoothly, complications became evident shortly
                        after. The patient developed persistent swelling, nostril asymmetry, and a visible
                        depression on the left side of her nose that persisted a year post OP. She also reported
                        discomfort and the sensation that something inside her nose wasn’t positioned correctly,

                        After being discharged, according to her account, Turan did not check in, offer
                        follow-up appointments, or respond meaningfully to concerns. The patient felt
                        abandoned during a critical recovery period, which may have contributed to the

                    <p>The patient experienced multiple complications following rhinoplasty with Dr. Turan
                        and expressed significant dissatisfaction with both the outcome and the aftercare. One
                        of the main concerns was a visible deviation and asymmetry in the nasal bridge, which
                        the patient believed resembled a collapsed nasal wall rather than typical post-operative
                        swelling. Additionally, the internal structure of the nose appeared uneven and abnormal
                        to the patient, and these issues did not improve over time.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The patient also reported that one nostril had difficulty healing and had previously been

                        felt dismissed when raising concerns. They described being given superficial advice, such
                        as wearing a nasal retainer for a longer period, which conflicted with guidance from
                        another medical professional. The patient felt this approach failed to address underlying

                        while still in the country were unsuccessful, and they were advised to wait, which they
                        felt only worsened the healing process. Overall, the patient expressed a strong sense of
                        being neglected in both communication and care and questioned whether their
                        outcome was truly prioritized.</p>

                        Dr. Selim Turan. While they does not blame him for an infection that occurred during
                        the first procedure, they made it clear before the second surgery that they did not want

                    <p>The patient's nose, which was already deviated before surgery, is now even more
                        noticeably crooked. Their breathing has worsened, and they have very asymmetric
                        nostrils, even though their nostrils were symmetric before. Both side profiles now look
                        different due to the deviation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The worst part for the patient has been the effect on their breathing. While their
                        breathing wasn't perfect before (due to the deviated septum), it has now become a huge
                        struggle, especially when it comes to sleeping and physical activity. The patient has to
                        tape their mouth shut every night just to avoid dry mouth from breathing through it.
                        Physical activities like fitness and dancing, which used to be part of their daily routine,
                        have become much more difficult due to the limited airflow. It has been deeply
                        depressing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The patient's first night in the hospital was an absolute nightmare. The nurse was clearly
                        unkind and treated them with disdain. When the patient needed help cleaning the blood
                        from their nose, the nurse intentionally took a long time to assist, causing blood to get
                        all over the patient's face and body. When they needed help to go to the toilet, the nurse
                        left the room after the patient entered the bathroom. The patient ended up collapsing
                        and losing consciousness when trying to return to their bed, without even being able to
                        cry out for help. It was a very traumatic experience. Thankfully, a receptionist noticed
                        and helped them.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>On top of that, the surgeon pushed the patient to get lip and chin fillers, even though
                        they never requested them, which felt extremely unprofessional.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When the patient later reached out to the surgeon about their nose looking crooked, the
                        surgeon claimed it was just swelling and advised them to "keep massaging it." When the
                        patient requested their before pictures, the surgeon completely ignored them.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The patient would not recommend this surgeon to anyone. The experience, both during
                        the surgery and the post-operative care, was disheartening, and the results have only
                        caused more issues than before.</p>

                <h2>Impact on Patients</h2>

                <h3>Physical Consequences</h3>
                <p>Patients have reported a wide range of physical complications that have significantly impacted their
                    quality of life:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Breathing Problems:</strong> Many patients experience severe breathing difficulties,
                        with
                        some requiring mouth taping at night and struggling with basic physical activities</li>
                    <li><strong>Structural Damage:</strong> Visible deformities, collapsed nasal valves, and improperly
                        placed grafts that create ongoing discomfort</li>
                    <li><strong>Functional Impairment:</strong> Loss of normal nasal function, chronic pain, and
                        difficulty
                        with sleep and exercise</li>
                    <li><strong>Scarring and Tissue Damage:</strong> Hypertrophic scars from alarplasty procedures,
                        necrotic
                        tissue, and permanent disfigurement</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Psychological and Emotional Impact</h3>
                <p>The psychological toll on patients has been severe and long-lasting:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identity Loss:</strong> Particularly affecting ethnic patients who feel their cultural
                        identity was surgically erased</li>
                    <li><strong>Trauma and PTSD:</strong> Multiple patients report developing PTSD from the surgical
                        violations and poor treatment</li>
                    <li><strong>Depression and Anxiety:</strong> Ongoing mental health struggles related to their
                        altered
                        appearance and functional problems</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Isolation:</strong> Patients report withdrawing from social activities due to
                        embarrassment about their results</li>
                    <li><strong>Suicidal Ideation:</strong> Some patients have reported feeling suicidal due to the
                        severity
                        of their complications</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Financial Burden</h3>
                <p>The financial impact extends far beyond the initial surgery cost:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Revision Surgery Costs:</strong> Patients facing $50,000+ revision surgeries to correct
                        damage</li>
                    <li><strong>Additional Medical Care:</strong> Ongoing treatment for infections, breathing problems,
                        and
                        other complications</li>
                    <li><strong>Lost Income:</strong> Time off work for multiple surgeries and recovery periods</li>
                    <li><strong>Travel Expenses:</strong> Multiple trips for attempted corrections and consultations
                        with
                        other surgeons</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Recommendations for Patient Safety</h2>

                <h3>Before Choosing Any Surgeon</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Research Thoroughly:</strong> Look beyond curated social media posts and promotional
                        materials</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek Multiple Opinions:</strong> Consult with several surgeons before making a decision
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Verify Credentials:</strong> Ensure the surgeon is properly certified and has relevant
                        training</li>
                    <li><strong>Review Realistic Cases:</strong> Ask to see before/after photos of patients with similar
                        anatomy to yours</li>
                    <li><strong>Understand Risks:</strong> Ensure you fully understand all potential complications and
                        their
                        likelihood</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust Your Instincts:</strong> If something feels wrong during consultation, consider it
                        a
                        warning sign</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Protecting Yourself During the Process</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Document Everything:</strong> Keep detailed records of all communications and promises
                        made
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Bring Support:</strong> Have a trusted friend or family member present during
                        consultations
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Read Contracts Carefully:</strong> Understand exactly what procedures are and aren't
                        included</li>
                    <li><strong>Establish Clear Boundaries:</strong> Be explicit about what you do and don't want done
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Plan for Complications:</strong> Understand the revision policy and who pays for
                        corrections
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>If You Experience Problems</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Document Issues:</strong> Take photos and keep detailed records of complications</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek Second Opinions:</strong> Get independent medical evaluations of your condition
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Don't Accept Blame:</strong> Complications are often due to surgical errors, not patient
                        factors</li>
                    <li><strong>Know Your Rights:</strong> Understand local laws regarding medical malpractice and
                        patient
                        rights</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider Reporting:</strong> File complaints with relevant medical boards if appropriate
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Seek Support:</strong> Connect with other patients who have had similar experiences</li>

                <div class="quote-box">
                    <p>The purpose of this compilation is not to defame or attack, but to provide prospective patients
                        with
                        information that is often hidden or suppressed. Every patient deserves to make an informed
                        decision
                        based on complete information, not just carefully curated marketing materials.</p>

                    <p>If you are considering surgery with Dr. Selim Turan or any cosmetic surgeon, please take these
                        accounts seriously. While some patients may have had positive experiences, the pattern of
                        complications, poor communication, and unethical behavior documented here represents serious
                        concerns that should not be ignored.</p>

                    <p>Your safety, well-being, and informed consent should always be the top priority. If any surgeon
                        dismisses your concerns, pressures you into procedures, or fails to provide transparent
                        information
                        about risks and outcomes, consider that a red flag.</p>

                    <p>Remember: You only get one face and one nose. Make your decision based on thorough research,
                        multiple
                        consultations, and honest patient experiences – not marketing hype or social media promotion.
